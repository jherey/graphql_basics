# GraphQL

My GraphQL level up resource

## Getting started
Every GraphQL schema has three special root types, these are called `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`
The fields on these root types are called `root field` and define the available API operations.

- typeDefs: These are the type definitions from your application schema.
- resolvers: This is a JavaScript object that mirrors the Query, Mutation and Subscription types and their fields from your application schema. Each              field in the application schema is represented by a function with the same name in that object.
- context: This is an object that gets passed through the resolver chain and every resolver can read from or write to.


When the type of a root field is an object type, you can further expand the query (or mutation/subscription) with fields of that object type. The expanded part is called `selection set`.

Let‚Äôs now consider a slightly more advanced example:

```
type Query {
  users: [User!]!
  user(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!): User!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```
A few things to note
```
For the fields in the selection set, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the type of the root field is required or a list. In the examples schema above, the three root fields all have different type modifiers (i.e. different combinations of being a list and/or required) for the User type:

- For the users field, the return type [User!]! means it returns a list (which itself can not be null) of User elements. The list can also not contain elements that are null. So, you‚Äôre always guaranteed to either receive an empty list or a list that only contains non-null User objects.
- For the user(id: ID!) field, the return type User means the returned value could be null or a User object.
- For the createUser(name: String!) field, the return type User! means this operation always returns a User object.
```

## Creating a simple query
#### Extending the schema definition
In general, when adding a new feature to the API, the process will look pretty similar every time:

1. Extend the GraphQL schema definition with a new root field (and new data types, if needed)
2. Implement corresponding resolver functions for the added fields

This process is also referred to as schema-driven or schema-first development.

#### The query resolution process
Every field inside the schema definition is backed by one resolver function whose responsibility it is to return the data for precisely that field.
Consider again the query from above:
```
query {
  feed {
    id
    url
    description
  }
}
```
A resolver function will be invoked for `feed`, `id`, `url` and `description`.

The first argument, commonly called `parent` (or sometimes `root`) is the result of the previous resolver execution level. But what does that mean? ü§î

Well, as you already saw, GraphQL queries can be nested. Each level of nesting (i.e. nested curly braces) corresponds to one resolver execution level. The above query therefore has two of these execution levels.

On the first level, it invokes the `feed` resolver and returns the entire data stored in `links`. For the second execution level, the GraphQL server is smart enough to invoke the resolvers of the `Link` type (because thanks to the schema, it knows that `feed` returns a list of Link elements) for each element inside the list that was returned on the previous resolver level. Therefore, in every of the three `Link` resolvers, the incoming parent object is the element inside the `links` list.


## Adding a Database
Prisma provides a convenient data access layer which is taking care of resolving queries for you. When using Prisma, you‚Äôre implementing your resolvers such that they‚Äôre simply forwarding incoming queries to the underlying Prisma engine which in turn resolves the query against the actual database.
The Prisma server provides the data access layer in your application architecture, making it easy for your API server to talk to the database through Prisma. The API of the Prisma server is consumed by the Prisma client inside your API server implementation (similar to an ORM).

`prisma.yml` is the main configuration file for your Prisma setup. `datamodel.prisma` on the other hand contains the definition of your datamodel. The Prisma datamodel defines your application‚Äôs models. Each model will be mapped to a table in the underlying database.

There are two main differences compared to the previous Link version from schema.graphql.

First, you‚Äôre adding the @id directive to the id: ID! field. This means Prisma will auto-generate and store globally unique IDs for the Link records in the database on the id field.

Second, you‚Äôre adding a new field called createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt. Thanks to the @createdAt directive, this field is also managed by Prisma and will be read-only in the API. It stores the time for when a specific Link was created. You can also annotate a field with the @updatedAt directive to track when a record was last updated.


#### The context argument
The `context` argument is a plain JavaScript object that every resolver in the resolver chain can read from and write to - it thus basically is a means for resolvers to communicate. As you‚Äôll see in a bit, it‚Äôs also possible to already write to it at the moment when the GraphQL server itself is being initialized. So, it‚Äôs also a way for you to pass arbitrary data or functions to the resolvers. In this case, you‚Äôre going to attach this `prisma` client instance to the `context` - more about that soon.


## Realtime GraphQL Subscriptions

#### What are GraphQL subscriptions?
Subscriptions are a GraphQL feature that allows a server to send data to its clients when a specific event happens. Subscriptions are usually implemented with WebSockets. In that setup, the server maintains a steady connection to its subscribed client. This also breaks the ‚ÄúRequest-Response-Cycle‚Äù that were used for all previous interactions with the API.

Instead, the client initially opens up a long-lived connection to the server by sending a subscription query that specifies which event it is interested in. Every time this particular event happens, the server uses the connection to push the event data to the subscribed client(s).

#### Subscriptions with Prisma
Luckily, Prisma comes with out-of-the-box support for subscriptions.

For each model in your Prisma datamodel, Prisma lets you subscribe to the following events:

- A new model is `created`
- An existing model `updated`
- An existing model is `deleted`

You can subscribe to these events using the $subscribe method of the Prisma client.

Resolvers for subscriptions are slightly different than the ones for queries and mutations:

1. Rather than returning any data directly, they return an `AsyncIterator` which subsequently is used by the GraphQL server to push the event data to the client.
2. Subscription resolvers are wrapped inside an object and need to be provided as the value for a `subscribe` field. You also need to provide another field called `resolve` that actually returns the data from the data emitted by the `AsyncIterator`.


## Filtering, Pagination & Sorting

#### Filtering
Thanks to Prisma, you‚Äôll be able to implement filtering capabilities to your API without major effort. Similar to the previous chapters, the heavy-lifting of query resolution will be performed by the powerful Prisma engine. All you need to do is forward incoming queries to it.

#### Pagination
Pagination is a tricky topic in API design. On a high-level, there are two major approaches regarding how it can be tackled:

- Limit-Offset: Request a specific chunk of the list by providing the indices of the items to be retrieved (in fact, you‚Äôre mostly providing the start index (offset) as well as a count of items to be retrieved (limit)).
- Cursor-based: This pagination model is a bit more advanced. Every element in the list is associated with a unique ID (the cursor). Clients paginating through the list then provide the cursor of the starting element as well as a count of items to be retrieved.

Limit and offset are called differently in the Prisma API:

- The limit is called `first`, meaning you‚Äôre grabbing the first x elements after a provided start index. Note that you also have a `last` argument available which correspondingly returns the last x elements.
- The start index is called `skip`, since you‚Äôre skipping that many elements in the list before collecting the items to be returned. If `skip` is not provided, it‚Äôs `0` by default. The pagination then always starts from the beginning of the list (or the end in case you‚Äôre using `last`).
